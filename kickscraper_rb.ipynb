Ryan Hansen and Ryan Devlin have shot two new hilarious introduction videos, which you can watch along with a few deleted scenes and outtakes, between <i>Play It Again, Dick</i> episodes at <a href=\\\"http://cwseed.com/this-dick-saves-lives/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">http://cwseed.com/this-dick-saves-lives/</a>.

As some of you may remember, Ryan played Mercer in Season 3 of <b>Veronica Mars</b>; in <b>Play It Again, Dick</b>, he takes on a very different role… and I think I’ll leave it at that. Ryan has started a company – with Kristen Bell and some friends – called <b>This Bar Saves Lives</b>. You can find out all about them here: </p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://thisbarsaveslives.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">thisbarsaveslives.com</a> </p>\\n<p>The bars are all-natural and gluten-free, made from fair trade ingredients from all over America. And for every bar sold, a packet of life-saving food is given to a child in need around the world. We’re big fans of <b>This Bar Saves Lives,</b> Dick is a big fan of <b>This Bar Saves Lives,</b> and we’re ecstatic to share this wonderful cause with all of you. Ryan has been kind enough to offer 20% off orders at <a href=\\\"http://thisbarsaveslives.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">thisbarsaveslives.com</a> for our Kickstarter backers - just enter the appropriately amusing promo code: <b>DICK</b>. </p>\\n<p>A big thanks to everyone involved in making <b>Play It Again, Dick</b> a reality, and a huge, eternal thanks to all of our backers for continuing to support all things <b>Veronica Mars</b>.

With iZombie in full swing, another Veronica Mars book in the hopper, AND the start of the college and pro football seasons, I haven’t been able to update you in awhile. \\nYou are, however, always close to my heart – and that’s why I’m so happy to share with you our next Veronica Mars-related project: <b>Play It Again, Dick</b>. </p><p>As you may have already heard, <b>Play It Again, Dick</b> is a digital series that follows Ryan Hansen as he tries to get a Dick Casablancas show off the ground. As Ryan says in his pitch to the CW network: </p><p><i>“It’s like a Veronica Mars that isn’t afraid of sex. Rob always called me the dessert of the show. Why not a show that’s all dessert? We drop all the who-gives-a-damn high school-is-a-metaphor-for-something-or-other and just give the people what they want: Dick!” </i></p><p>And while you’ll see several familiar faces from the <i>Veronica Mars</i> universe, the web series isn’t what you’d call “canon.” We know how much you would love to see Veronica and friends back in another movie or a new TV series – believe me, we’d love nothing more ourselves – but in the meantime, we had an opportunity to present a different, skewed, slightly absurd take on these characters, and on the actors who play them. So we ran with it, and had a blast. We think you will too. </p><p>The series will debut on Tuesday, September 16, on the CW Seed:</p><p><a href=\\\"http://cwseed.com/shows/play-it-again-dick/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">http://cwseed.com/shows/play-it-again-dick/</a></p><p> A new episode will air each week after that – for a total of eight episodes, each about 7-10 minutes long. And, as a special treat for our Kickstarter family... here’s an advance look at the AWESOME poster:\\n</p><div class=\\\"template asset\\\" data-edit_url=\\\"/projects/559914737/the-veronica-mars-movie-project/posts/981242/assets/2563205/edit\\\" data-id=\\\"2563205\\\"></div>\\n<p>Told you it was awesome.

I know that it’s been a while because, since the last update, we found out that iZOMBIE was picked up as a midseason show on the CW, we staffed up the show, and we assembled a writers room which started work last week.</p><p>So, yes, a lot has been happening.</p><p>Believe it or not, we do still have another update or two to share with you after this one, but today, I just wanted to share three quick updates.</p><p>Keep reading for details about our nominations in the Teen Choice Awards, a few hints about the next <i>Veronica Mars</i> novel, and a new chance to see Kristen, Jason and Enrico live in Los Angeles, while helping a worthwhile cause.</p><h1>1. More Voting: The 2014 Teen Choice Awards!</h1><p>I’ve never been to the Teen Choice Awards, but I’m told that in <i>some</i> circles, they are more important than the Oscars. I suspect those are teenage circles, but as they say, “It’s an honor just to be nominated.” </p><p>And this year, we've been nominated for the Teen Choice Awards in three categories: </p><ul>\\r\\n<li>\\r\\n<i>Veronica Mars</i> for Best Movie (Drama)</li>\\r\\n<li>Kristen Bell for Best Actress (Drama)</li>\\r\\n<li>Jason Dohring for Best Actor (Drama)</li>\\r\\n</ul><p>Just like the Oscars, you can vote once per day until August 10, when the award show will be broadcast on FOX. So if you miss helping us upset the odds and win awards, <a href=\\\"http://www.teenchoiceawards.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">vote now</a>!</p><h1>2. Veronica Mars Returns in… Mr. Kiss-And-Tell.</h1><p>After the first <i>Veronica Mars</i> novel — <i>The Thousand Dollar Tan Line</i> — was released, a lot of you wrote to share your thoughts. And since the book managed to hit #2 on <i>The New York Times</i> Bestseller List for trade paperbacks, there were a lot of thoughts. Most of them were positive and enthusiastic.</p><p>However, we also received a number of letters that went something like this:</p><p>“WHY WASN’T THERE MORE LOGAN?!?!?” </p><p>If you fell into that camp, then you’ll be pleased to know that you can expect a lot more Logan in <i>Mr. Kiss-And-Tell</i>, the follow up novel, which we’re on schedule to release late this year. It will take place a few months after the events of <i>The Thousand Dollar Tan Line</i>. And for those of you wondering about some of the unanswered questions raised in the movie — Who was responsible for *****’s murder? Who planted a gun on ******?  — the book will also return to those questions.</p><p>You can find the full “official” description of the book on Amazon, where <i>Mr. Kiss-And-Tell</i> is <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Veronica-Mars-Original-Mystery-Vintage/dp/080417072X/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">available for preorder</a>, and as we get closer to release, I’ll do my best to get an excerpt for you. Unless you’re tired of <i>Veronica Mars</i>. </p><p>In which case, you’re probably not reading these updates anymore.</p><h1>3. Another chance to hang out with our cast.</h1><p>Finally, if you’ve been on Kickstarter over the past month — or reading the news — you might be aware of <a href=\\\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/readingrainbow/bring-reading-rainbow-back-for-every-child-everywh\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">LeVar Burton’s campaign to bring back <i>Reading Rainbow</i></a>, the long-time PBS program dedicated to helping children develop a love of reading.</p><p>Just over a year ago, during our own campaign, we set Kickstarter’s All-Time Record for Most Backers, when 91,585 of you came together to help bring Veronica back. This morning, we’re pleased to pass that title to <i>Reading Rainbow</i>, which has passed our record, and still has two more days to go. </p><p>In fact, we believe their mission — to bring Reading Rainbow to underfunded classrooms — is so important that we’re going to do <i>more</i> than just congratulate them.

The last several weeks have been spent on non-stop editing of the iZOMBIE pilot, which is now complete, and — as of yesterday — <a href=\\\"http://www.deadline.com/2014/05/cw-series-orders-2014-flash-izombie-jane-the-virgin-messengers/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">has been picked up</a> as a series. Next week, I’ll find out whether it’ll debut in the fall or as a mid-season replacement. Either way, we’ll be getting to work on it soon. </p><p>But now that I have a little bit more time, I wanted to send another update. I know that you received a message from Customer Support yesterday; if you’re still waiting on any of your rewards, I hope that you took the time to read it. </p><p>In case you didn’t, let me give you the quick version: </p><p><b>If you’re still missing or having problems with any of your Kickstarter rewards, please email info@theveronicamarsmovie.com ASAP and let them know.</b></p><p><b>After June 1, we won’t be able to help with unclaimed rewards, offer replacements, or issue any additional refunds – and we want to make sure you’re taken care of. </b></p><p>Now that we’ve cleared that up, let’s cover a few other updates.</p><h1>THE DVD &amp; BLU-RAY </h1><p> At this point, I hope that most of you — or at least, those of you who pledged at $50 and up — have received the promised DVD and/or Blu-ray versions of <i>Veronica Mars</i>. (If your rewards didn’t include a physical copy of the movie, it’s also available to <a href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/TheVeronicaMarsMovie/app_546888952085092?ref=br_tf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">purchase now</a>, in almost all countries.) </p><p><b>German and Austrian Backers:</b> I promise, if we were <i>allowed</i> to send your copies of the movie now, we would. The truth is, getting a German theatrical release required some different timing restrictions for releasing the DVD. You’ll receive your reward copies as <i>soon</i> as they are available for sale in your countries — as of now, I believe that will be around July 24. In the meantime, hopefully your digital copies will make it easier to wait.</p><h1>“BY THE FANS” – OUR BEHIND-THE-SCENES DOC </h1><p>Even without the DVD or Blu-Ray, I’m hoping most of you have already had the chance to watch the movie. When your DVD and Blu-ray arrive, however, I encourage you to spend a little time to watch <b><i>By The Fans</i></b>, our behind-the-scenes documentary about the Kickstarter campaign, the making of the movie, and — most of all — <i>your</i> role in making that possible.</p><p>We began shooting <i>By The Fans</i> on March 13, 2013 — the same morning we launched the Kickstarter campaign — and continued until just after our visit to San Diego Comic-Con in July. If you’ve been reading these updates, you’ll already have a good idea of what was happening behind-the-scenes, but there’s a lot more in the documentary. </p><p>If you’ve watched it, we’d love to hear what you thought. Let us know in the comments. </p><p>On a related note:</p><h1>A NEW KICKSTARTER, FROM THE GUY WHO BROUGHT YOU “BY THE FANS”... </h1><p>If you enjoy <i>By The Fans</i>, most of the credit goes to the talented young man who directed and co-edited it, Viet Nguyen. </p><p>Some of you might know that my relationship with Viet actually started more than twenty years ago in Austin, where I was his high school broadcast journalism advisor. Later, after he graduated from UT Film School, I hired him as a post-production PA on the first season of <i>Veronica Mars</i>. From there, Viet climbed to Assistant Editor on <i>Veronica Mars</i>, and we hired him as a full-fledged editor on <i>Party Down</i>. When we got together to create our Kickstarter launch video a couple years ago, Viet was the one who shot and edited it, and over the last several weeks, he worked with me to edit the iZOMBIE pilot. </p><p>What you probably <i>don’t</i> know is that Viet might also be responsible for my entire writing career. While I was his teacher, he secretly cut a video nominating me for Channel One Teacher of the Year. I didn't get the award, but Channel One offered me a job, and I moved out to Los Angeles. I quit my band in order to make the move, and I filled the creative void by writing my first novel, Rats Saw God, that year. I was 28 at the time. </p><p>So if you enjoyed <i>By The Fans</i> — or, in a sense, anything I’ve ever written — you can thank Viet. And if you’re not sure <i>how</i> to thank him, here’s my suggestion: </p><p><b>Help him out with the <a href=\\\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/viet-nguyen/crush-the-skull-horror-comedy-feature-film\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Kickstarter <i>he</i> just launched</a> to finance his own feature film debut. </b></p><p>I already did. It’s based on two amazing short film thrillers that Viet has directed. I love both <i>Crush the Skull</i> <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBsrzEp-XSg\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">short</a> <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b38cDngY8Y\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">films</a>. If he can do these with a few hundred dollars, he'll kick a lot of ass with a few thousand dollars.\\r\\n</p><h1>A GUIDE TO NAME DROPPING</h1><p>In one of my last updates, I <a href=\\\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/559914737/the-veronica-mars-movie-project/posts/786855\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">pointed out the scene</a> in <i>Veronica Mars</i> which featured the “cameo appearance” of our $10,000 backer, Steven Dengler. Today, I thought I’d share another fun easter egg — or six easter eggs -- and reveal the Kickstarter backers whose names were included in the movie. </p><p><b>(Minor spoilers follow, if you haven't seen the movie yet.)</b></p><p><b>BACKER #1</b>. When we first see Piz, he’s working on a story for <i>This American Life</i> about a struggling artist named <b>Zhi Howes</b>. (This was probably a surprise to Zhi, since she is nine years old.

A podcast from KCRW!</h1><p>Finally, a few more links for anyone suffering <i>Veronica Mars</i> withdrawal. </p><p>If you weren't able to catch the livestream of our panel at <b>PALEYFEST</b>, we're still waiting to find out whether we can get a full video to share with you. </p><p>For now, the Paley Center has <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAQK0w5Dw8E\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">posted this excerpt</a>:</p><div class=\\\"template oembed\\\" data-href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAQK0w5Dw8E\\\"><a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAQK0w5Dw8E\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAQK0w5Dw8E</a></div><p>Or, if you prefer listening to watching, <b>KCRW's <i>The Business</i> </b>podcast <a href=\\\"http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/tb/tb140324making_veronica_mars\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">has a fun segment</a> about Veronica, Kickstarter, and what our movie might mean for the future.</p><p>--</p><p>That's all for now.
